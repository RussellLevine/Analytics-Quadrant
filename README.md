# Analytics-Quadrant
Presentation to describe analytics initiatives

This asset is useful in a number of pre-sales scenarios, mostly in an introductory, conversation starting setting. The point is to engage the customer to help identify challenges where IBM analytic solutions can be applied. While this presentation format is PowerPoint for ease of distribution, the whiteboard is designed to be done by hand with a simple chart, text and very basic drawings.
